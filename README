Various "dot files" for Unix utilities, such as bash, vim, and tmux.

Many of the files in this repo are dot files (as you would expect) and
thus are not visible to "ls" unless you view hidden files.

The "src" directory is intended to be copied to the root of a home
directory to load all dotfiles.

You can install the dot files by changing directory to the directory
containing this readme, and then executing ./install-dotfiles.pl - This
script will make symlinks in your home directory that point at the files
in the src directory for all the files in that src directory.  It also
renames old files on the first run.  On future runs, it skips any files
that already exist.  The symlinks allow you to keep your dotfiles
updated just by running a "git pull".

Note that ./install-dotfiles.pl, after the first execution, will
overwrite templates in .vim/templates where there is a file of the same
name ending in .base in the same directory.

This repo probably shouldn't be used as-is, unless you are J. Maslak.
I've added my preferences in these files, but many of these preferences
are things two different developers/sysadmins may disagree about.
That's okay!  Feel free to modify them to your own style.
