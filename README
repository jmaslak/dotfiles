Various "dot files" for Unix utilities, such as bash, vim, and tmux.

Many of the files in this repo are dot files (as you would expect)
and thus are not visible to "ls" unless you view hidden files.

The "src" directory is intended to be copied to the root of a home
directory to load all dotfiles.

You can install the dot files by changing directory to the directory
containing this readme, and then executing ./install-dotfiles.pl -
This script will make symlinks in your home directory that point at
the files in the src directory for all the files in that src
directory.  It also renames old files on the first run.  On future
runs, it skips any files that already exist.  The symlinks allow
you to keep your dotfiles updated just by running a "git pull".
