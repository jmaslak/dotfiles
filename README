Various "dot files" for Unix utilities, such as bash, vim, and tmux.

Many of the files in this repo are dot files (as you would expect)
and thus are not visible to "ls" unless you view hidden files.

The "src" directory is intended to be copied to the root of a home
directory to load all dotfiles.
